Dynamic pricing relates to the set of problems where firms are required to set prices in response to state variables to maximise their revenue. Traditional approaches assume a functional form of the demand function and optimise for its parameters to find the optimal pricing solution. Reinforcement learning is a powerful tool, suitable for learning pricing policies under uncertainty of the reward function. It is a non-parametric method where a functional form of the function does not have to be assumed and the relationship is learned by trial and error. Therefore, RL is a relevant method for dynamic pricing problems with uncertain demand.
