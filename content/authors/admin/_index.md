I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Statistical Science, UCL. My research interests include multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning, multi-tasking and transfer learning. I am particularly interested in combining (inverse) reinforcement learning and game theory to model multi-agent systems in asymmetric games. With my background in economics, I want to apply these methods to modelling the behaviours of individuals not only in markets as consumers but also in the choices they make (in a behavioural economics sort of way). 

I use the [posts](#posts) part of this page to keep notes about topics that I find interesting, though not always directly related to my research. As time permits, I implement the methods myself (head over to my [github](https://github.com/martagrz/)) although sometimes I will only write short notes. These pages will occasionally be updated after they are posted. For what I am currently working on, see the [projects](#projects) part of this page. 

My project is kindly sponsored by [Just-Eat plc](https://www.justeatplc.com/) and I am supervised by [Petros Dellaportas](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakpde/).
